# nnw-allmine

This is a personal customisation of the default NetNewsWire theme. It alters the
fonts to a more Humanist style and sets the preferred code font to my favourite.

- Alter code block style to remove border and add background.
- Alter article and code font.
- Set either [IBM Plex Sans] or Seravek (built into iOS and macOS) as article
  font.
- Set [JetBrains Mono] as code font, if it's installed.

The screenshot shows both IBM Plex Sans and JetBrains Mono:
